clustering_coding_challenge
==============================

This coding challenge is used in Danaher's recruiting process.  Data, code, and repository links may not be used or
shared outside of this recruiting process.

In the data/raw directory are thirteen data files.  Each file represents an experiment where a number of features of a system are 
measured.  Each file has a large number of multi-dimensional data points.  The objective is to create one algorithm that will 
cluster every file and maximize the correspondence of predicted cluster and labeled cluster for each data point.

Notes:
  - Each file represents an independent system
  - Not all columns are available in all files
  - Label numbers between different files do not correspond.  E.g., a label of '2' in file A does not means the same cluster 
    as label '2' in file B.
  - One algorithm should cluster all files

Note that there is no specific right or wrong answer, be sure to illustrate how you arrived at your solution.  Return your results 
as a separate GitHub repository.  Include all source code, notebooks, intermediary data, and so forth.

Questions may be forwarded to the recruiter.  Candidates have one week to complete this challenge.
